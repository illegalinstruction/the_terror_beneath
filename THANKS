The project would not exist without the gracious contributions 
of the following people:

* The Munson typeface, used in the discovery distance indicators was created
by Paul James Miller - more of their work is here:
https://www.1001fonts.com/users/pjmiller/ 

* Much inspiration for the sound design was drawn from looking at NOAA's 
website.  They can be found at 
https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/sound01/background/seasounds/seasounds.html

* The work of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave us a -lot-
of visual references:  They're here:

* Opera Lyrics Smooth, the main menu and HUD primary typeface, was
created by Dennis Bathory-Kitsz.  More about their work - including
