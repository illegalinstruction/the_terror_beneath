# the_terror_beneath
Submarine exploration game, built for a summer course in game dev.

**Requires** Godot 3.5.x ~~or later~~.  (3.4 and earlier are missing some shader directives we rely on, 4.x looks like it might need too many scene and GDScript changes.)

# Build instructions:

1. Download [Godot 3.5.2 LTS](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/), along with the export templates, and launch it.
1. [Clone](https://github.com/illegalinstruction/the_terror_beneath.git) the source tree.
1. In the Godot Project Manager, import from the `godot` folder from the code downloaded in the previous step.
1. Double-click the newly-imported project to open it.
1. Click `Export`, choose a target platform, and follow the instructions in the dialogue box.

For more info about what the game does or how things are implemented, please see the wiki.
